# Class 18 -  Project Week: Milestone 3
## Reaching MVP Day

1. As always, start with a daily standup to assess how the last day went, and then plan today accordingly.

2. Your goal today: MVP. You want to have everything working, all of your core features in place, and the bugs worked out. That will leave tomorrow for accomplishing stretch goals and getting the look and feel dialed in.

3. It's never too soon to start thinking about your presentation and I'd encourage testing your project on one of the projectors in the classroom spaces. Everything will look just a little different on the projector screen and you should anticipate that prior to delivering your presentation.
