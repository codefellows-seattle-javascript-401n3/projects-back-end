# Class 19 -  Project Week: Milestone 4
## Presentation Prep Day

1. Test your presentation:
 * As your team now has MVP in place and is focusing more on layout, design, and stretch goal, take a few minutes at some point to go to the classroom and take a look at your app on the projector/screen setup. You'll be glad you did. It's often a moment of, "THAT'S not what we want it to look like!" We'll strive to have the instructor/TAs do this with each team.

2. Plan your presentation...have a script:
 * Who will give an intro about the problem domain and your team's solution for it?
 * Who will talk about the functionality and walk us through the app?
 * Who will walk us through the code and tell the audience about a technical challenge your team overcame during development?
 * Individually, each team member should speak about the challenges that arose during project week, how your team overcame them, how you contributed to the solution, what you learned, and what you enjoyed working on.

3. Rehearse your presentation:
 * Decide who's laptop will present the app on the projector. Test it, and then test a second laptop just in case.
 * Set a timer and take turns talking through your topics. Know how much time each segment will take.

4. Overall presentation durations:
 * 5 minutes - Intro/demo problem domain and solution
 * 3 minutes - Technical challenge shown in the code
 * 3 minutes per team member - Each team member speaks about their challenges, lessons learned, etc.
 * Extra 5-10 minutes - Q&A
