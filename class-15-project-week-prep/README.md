### Process:

2. Throughout project week, your team must work on-campus so we can help whenever your team is stuck.
3. On the last day of project week, your team must present your project in front of the class.

## Project proposals

By midday of the first day of project week, your team must submit a proposal to an instructor with the following information:

 - Your team's name
 - Your team's members
 - Your project's pitch. (What is the problem statement and what are the benefits of your solution? Read more about these [here](https://www.bidsketch.com/proposal-resources/proposal-templates/web-design-proposal-template).)
 - A diagram of relevant details from your project's domain model
 - A few wireframe sketches of your project's pages

**TIP:** Use pencil and paper to diagram and sketch.

Proposals, written or electronic, as per the project description, are due for review with the instruction team. First come, first served!
