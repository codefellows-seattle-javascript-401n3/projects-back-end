# Class 16 - Project Week: Milestone 1
## Development Kickoff

### Organizing your team:

1. Elect a **Launch Driver** who will be responsible for the following:
 * Driving the coding of the initial scaffolding phase.
 * Hosting the code under their GitHub account (or create a new GitHub organization for your team and an organizational repo for the project).
2. The rest of the team will be **Launch Navigators** and responsible for the following:
 * Navigating the coding of the initial scaffolding phase.
 * Staying one-step ahead of the Launch Driver by researching unfamiliar technology.
3. Once everyone is in agreement, here's how to launch a new  project.
 * Build a basic file scaffold from scratch **as a team**.
 * Initialize a new git repository (in a personal or organization account).
 * Push it to GitHub and [add your team members as Collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/).

### Daily Standups
As project week progresses hold daily “stand-up” meetings. A stand-up meeting should take no more than 10-15 minutes. The purpose is to facilitate communications among team members about the ongoing work of the project.

In a stand-up meeting each person will, in turn, present:

1. A brief statement of what they worked on yesterday.
2. A brief statement of what they plan on working on today.
3. A brief statement of “blockers”, issues that are preventing them completing some task.

If there are questions that arise from these statements, or if you have any questions for the team, hold them until after this first round of reporting. Once all team members have reported, return to any questions that need answering. Once all questions are answered, call an end to the meeting and move on to work.

Avoid turning your statements into play-by-play analysis of each activity. Keep things brief and quick.

An instructor or a TA **must** attend your stand-up meeting. Do not hold one without a member of the teaching team present.
