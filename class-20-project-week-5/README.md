## Project Submission Process

To successfully submit your project, complete the processes in order, for GitHub and Canvas below:

### Part One - GitHub:

1. Up to this point youâ€™ve done your work on a branch, ensuring that your master branch is kept safe. Now make a Pull Request back to your master branch when you are finished and then deploy your completed work to Heroku.

2. For your submission, you will create a special pull request. On your development machine, determine the last commit you made to the repository **PRIOR** to starting **your** work on this assignment or project. Checkout it by providing the commit hash as the argument to git checkout, for example:

 `$ git checkout 1a39dc40`

3. Once you've made that checkout, you will see that you are in "detached HEAD" state. From here create a new branch called start:

 `$ git checkout -b start`

4. Then, push this branch up to your repository in GitHub:

 `$ git push -u origin start`

5. Finally, make a Pull Request in GitHub from your master branch to the new start branch. This will result in a Pull Request containing all the code you've written yourself. **Do not merge this pull request.**

6. You will submit two links to us for grading. One will be the link to your Pull Request in GitHub. The other will be the link to your deployed project on Heroku. Continue to the Canvas section below.

### Part Two - Canvas:

1. Make sure your group is formed on Canvas. To do this, open the course on Canvas, select the People link in the left sidebar, and then the Groups tab at the top. Finally, select the Join link to the right of the appropriate project group. Everyone in your group should complete this process prior to the submission of the assignment.

1. There are two Canvas assignments that cover Projects, one for just you and one for the whole team. Only **one** team member needs to submit this `Final Project - Group Submission` assignment. However, **each team member will need to individually submit** the `Final Project - Individual Submission` assignment on Canvas.  
 - Group Submission  
        1. Complete the Google Form on the Canvas assignment page.  
        2. Include links to your:
            1. GitHub Pull Request
            2. Heroku deployed project in the text field the Canvas assignment provides.

 - Individual Submission  
    1. Complete the Canvas Assignment `Final Project - Individual Submission`.

## Congratulations!
Thanks for all your hard work!
