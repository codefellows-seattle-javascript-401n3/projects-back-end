# Code Fellows Project Week Instructions
This is a standard set of instructions for students to follow for each day of Project Week including the class right before Project Week officially starts (`class-15-project-week-prep`).

`class-20-project-week-5` contains instructions for how students submit their assignments with a _reverse pull request_ and the two associated Canvas assignments.
